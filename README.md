1.  Send custom events from a browser to Rest API. It is advisable to use contract from Google Analytics to rise an event. Please make a simple registration form and a couple of buttons and whenever something is typed, an event should be triggered. Please use AngularJS (or similar frameworks).
2.  Implement Rest API using NodeJS to handle events from the tracker script and store the data in MongoDB. Please design the storage for high performance application that will have sharding and multiple requests per second. Using Sockets.io is beneficial.
3.  Implement AngularJS widget(s) that consumes your service from previous point and shows in near real-time amount of events per minute.
4.  In your solution please include Read.me where you will describe how to start the server (preferably “npm install && npm start”) and which files to use to simulate events and how to see the widgets.

Steps:
The first time. Code generated by:
> npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack
Useful commands:
> Create route
yo angular-fullstack:route main
> Generar endpoint
	yo angular-fullstack:endpoint register

To deploy the service
> bower install & npm install
> grunt serve //It listens on port 9001
> In mongo, creates a db named: use demoDB;
